1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A .git folder will be created in the repository folder. 
I need to initialize a repository because I want to do version control in that folder.

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area is like a temprorary folder that store the files from the repository before commit. Working directory is the folder that we are working on; and repository has a bunch of metadata that contains the version control information
