1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I am collobrating with others remotely.
When I want to edit my work but don't have my computer with me.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because sometimes one logical change has multiple changes, and I only want to pull the one logical change as one change 
on GitHub. If Git automatically stay up-to-date the changes will be a mess.

3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks: it's the "clone" between GitHub account
Clones: it happans between GitHub and local Git folder; or between local folders
Branches: it's the labels of commits
